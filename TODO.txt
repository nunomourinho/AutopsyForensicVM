----> Create a forensic image share configuration.
The fields forensic image source, share login, share password, and remote or local folder to share should be stored in a new file. This file should be saved inside the forensic-image path folder, within the UUID subfolder (referring to the forensic image).

---> Create a new webservice: The webservice should detect if the forensic image with the UUID exists, if it is running (the run.pid file exists).
It also should return the running mode (snap or copy). It should return the Current VNC PORT, WEBSOCKET PORT, and qmp socket

---> Create a new webservice that starts the machine in a remote screen session and returns the screen session

---> Create a new webservice that stops the machine

---> Create a new webservice that snapshots the machine via qmp and returns the image as a file.

---> Reorganize project: Create a folder with the external bin files, create a folder for config files, change code accordingly

---> In Jython code: Export tags to the python plugin using sql or the sleuthkit database.

---> Create the fields in the interface needed to create the virtual forensic analysis drive (size)

---> Change machine creation to include the virtual vmware folder. Investigate if it can be also a zip file (is it in the autorized autopsy file 
formats?)

---> Authentication: Integrate with google authentication

---> BONUS: Authentication: Integrate with autenticacao.gov (Portugal)
