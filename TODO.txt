---> The openfile should start on the case path and with the zip file extension
---> The download should present a progress bar in pythonsimplegui

---> Create a new webservice that creates a memory dump via qmp

---> Create a new webservice that downloads the memory dump as a zip file

---> Create a new webservice that downloads the evidence.vmdk



Run a machine in snap mode:
---> Change forensic2v script so that in the snap mode it creates a new script file with mount script to mount the dd, efw or
aff forensic image
---> Create a new webservice that mounts a folder inside the other folder
---> Change the webservice to also mount the original forensic image
---> Sequence to run: Determine free port on server, Create ssh connection with port redirect to samba port, mount samba share on mnt folder, mount image on efw or aff folder via script,      run the machine
---> Sequence to stop. Stop the machine, umount aff, umount mnt, terminate samba session

---> Create a new webservice that umounts a folder

---> BUG correction: create folder shares with spaces and convert machines with spaces

---> In Jython code: Export tags to the python plugin using sql or the sleuthkit database.

---> Create a new webservice that lists the machines available.

---> Create a new webservice that querys available cdroms in the iso files

---> Create a new webservice that uploads a big iso file, by chunks, to be called by ajax or pythonsimplegui

---> Create a new webservice that inserts a cdrom inside da virtual machine.

---> Create a new webservice that snapshots the machine via qmp and returns the image as a file.

---> Reorganize project: Create a folder with the external bin files, create a folder for config files, change code accordingly

---> Make adicional comments and code documentation

---> Create the fields in the interface needed to create the virtual forensic analysis drive (size)

---> Change machine creation to include the virtual vmware evidence folder. Investigate if it can be also a zip file (is it in the autorized autopsy file 
formats?)

---> Authentication: Integrate with google authentication

---> BONUS: Authentication: Integrate with autenticacao.gov (Portugal)
